## SUSHI

SUSHI is a DeFi exchange that supports token swapping and many other actions. We started by copying SUSHI's smart contracts into the [packages/analyzer/contracts](https://github.com/enyalabs/contracts-analyzer/tree/master/packages/analyzer/contracts) folder. Then, we ran:

```bash

yarn install
yarn build
yarn analyze

yarn deploy:local #may need additional configuration in /scripts/deployLocal.js
  # or...
yarn deploy:rinkeby #may need additional configuration in /scripts/deployRinkeby.js

```

We then addressed the warnings and errors one by one. 

## 1. No native ETH

In many smart contracts, ETH is handled slightly differently than ERC20 tokens, but on L2, there is no native ETH. Instead, L2s use an ERC20 representation of ETH such as wETH or oETH. This means that all ETH-specific functions can be deleted, since there are no longer needed. For example:

```diff

contracts/uniswapv2/interfaces/IUniswapV2Router01.sol 
@@ -16,14 +17,15 @@ interface IUniswapV2Router01 {
	...
-    function addLiquidityETH(
-        address token,
-        uint amountTokenDesired,
-        uint amountTokenMin,
-        uint amountETHMin,
-        address to,
-        uint deadline
-    ) external payable returns (uint amountToken, uint amountETH, uint liquidity);
+    // CHANGE_OMGX
+    // function addLiquidityETH(
+    //     address token,
+    //     uint amountTokenDesired,

+    //     address to,
+    //     uint deadline
+    // ) external payable returns (uint amountToken, uint amountETH, uint liquidity);

```

From a UI/Frontend perspective, 'native' ETH functions are no longer needed and integration test code will also need any ETH-specific tests to be commented out. In the case of the SUSHI port, among other changes, `contracts/mocks/WETH9Mock.sol` can be deleted entirely and many functions in `contracts/uniswapv2/UniswapV2Router02.sol` can also be deleted, such as `removeLiquidityETH` and `swapExactETHForTokens` etc. Removing functions in the contracts also affects the interfaces, of course, e.g. `contracts/uniswapv2/interfaces/IUniswapV2Router01.sol`.

## 2. Timing, `now`, and `block.timestamp`

The L2 does not have traditional blocks. Control over time, and manipulation of apparent time, is critical for L2, since during a fraud proof, the L1 contacts will need to replay the L2 contracts at specific times _in the past_ to check their correctness. `block.timestamp` returns the last L1 block in which a rollup batch was posted. This means that the `block.timestamp` returned on L2 can lag as many as 10 minutes behind L1. Depending on how `block.timestamp` is being used, this 1-10 min lag could have **serious unexpected implications**. See [OVM-vs-EVM-Block-Timestamps](https://hackmd.io/@scopelift/Hy853dTsP#OVM-vs-EVM-Block-Timestamps) for a more extensive discussion. Briefly, consider:

1. The OVM timestamp lags behind the EVM, so itâ€™s possible that e.g. OVM trades execute up 10 minutes after your specified deadline.  
2. `permit` method signatures contain a deadline, and the approval must be sent before that deadline. In certain cases, the approval could take place after the deadline.  
3. Bid and auction durations. If you are trying to run an auction with minute scale bid durations, then a 1-10 minute lag relative to L1 could throw that off completely.  

## 3. Replace `chainid()` with `uint256 chainId = ___`

```diff

contracts/SushiToken.sol
@@ -239,8 +241,8 @@ contract SushiToken is ERC20("SushiToken", "SUSHI"), Ownable {
	...
    function getChainId() internal pure returns (uint) {
-       uint256 chainId;
+       uint256 chainId = 28; //or whatever the L2 ChainID is...
+       //assembly { chainId := chainid() }

```

## 4. Update Depreciated Syntax

Not strictly L2 related, but updated it to help with future maintainability.

```diff

contracts/governance/Timelock.sol 
-   (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = target.call.value(value)(callData);
+   (bool success, bytes memory returnData) = target.call{value:value}(callData);

// The following syntax is deprecated: 
// f.gas(...)(), f.value(...)() and (new C).value(...)().
// Replace with:
// f{gas: ..., value: ...}() and (new C){value: ...}(). 

```

## 5. No tx.origin

L2 does not support `tx.origin`. This is typically a non-issue, since `tx.origin` is deprecated anyway and will be removed from L1 at some point. See [Vitalik's answer](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/196/how-do-i-make-my-dapp-serenity-proof). Secondly, only allowing txs from an EOA is considered an anti-pattern. It breaks composability, it prevents multisig wallets from using your product, and in general it's probably a hack to cover up some underlying security issues in the contracts. There is no easy/obvious one-line replacement for `tx.origin` - any attempt to try to detect the codesize or something of the calling contract would be spoofable. For Compound's use of `msg.sender == tx.origin`, as for Sushi, the best approach is to remove that restriction and make sure the contracts can safely handle calls from other contracts (which involves writing new code). For now, we just commented out the `require`.  

```diff

contracts/SushiMaker.sol
    // Try to make flash-loan exploit harder to do by only allowing externally owned addresses.
-   require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "SushiMaker: must use EOA");
+   //require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "SushiMaker: must use EOA");

```

## 6. TESTS RESULTS: All good EXCEPT evm_increaseTime and evm_mine

All tests clear EXCEPT things related to `evm_increaseTime` and `evm_mine`. Note that this does not affect the contracts _per se_ but affects testing. 

```

//working on this now...
const { latest, duration, increase } = require('./utilities/time');

```
